# Easing

Easing controls the way and the **rate of change** during the animation.

We can apply an easing on the **way in**, on the **way out** or **on both**. _By default the easing is set on the way out (`power1.out`)_.

In simple terms, it controls whether the animation should **speed up** or **slow down**.

```
gsap.to(linear, { x: 200, ease: 'linear' });
```

## Notes:

Some eases can be configured
